The hexagonal shape of the characters was chosen to give the font a modern and geometric look, which is both easy to read and visually unique. The hexagon structure makes the font stand out while the proportions, like how tall the letters are or how much space they take up, were carefully adjusted to make sure the letters are still easy to read.

The use of contrast and slight slanting adds a contemporary feel, while small design tweaks, like overshoot (where parts of the letters extend slightly) and tapering (where strokes become thinner), help the letters look more balanced and smooth. These features make the font great for use on websites or digital platforms, offering a bold and distinct style that remains clear, even when the text is small.

Adjustments like the vertical stretching and the size of the letter openings help the font stay sharp and readable, making sure it looks good on different screen sizes.
